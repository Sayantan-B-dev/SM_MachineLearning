# Bias

---

## **1. Core Idea**

Bias measures the **average error between model predictions and true values**.
It reflects how much the model **assumptions simplify the real-world data**.

[
\text{Bias} = \text{Expected}[\hat{f}(x)] - f(x)
]

Where:

* ( \hat{f}(x) ) = model prediction
* ( f(x) ) = true underlying function

---

## **2. Interpretation**

| Bias Level    | Training Error | Model Behavior                              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **High Bias** | High           | Model is too simple → **underfitting**      |
| **Low Bias**  | Low            | Model captures patterns well → **good fit** |

* **High bias → underfit** → fails on **training and test data**
* **Low bias → better prediction** → captures training patterns

---

## **3. Visual Intuition**

```
High Bias (Underfitting)
True function:      *****
Model prediction:   -----
Error: large difference

Low Bias (Good Fit)
True function:      *****
Model prediction:   ***** 
Error: small difference
```

---

## **4. Key Notes**

* Bias reflects **model assumptions** (simplicity vs complexity)
* High bias → model too rigid, ignores data patterns
* Bias is **one side of the bias-variance tradeoff**

---

## **5. Memory Hook**

* **“High bias = too simple → misses patterns”**
* **“Low bias = captures true patterns → good accuracy”**

---

# Variance

---

## **1. Core Idea**

Variance measures how much the model's predictions **change across different training datasets**.
It reflects the model’s **sensitivity to small fluctuations or noise** in the data.

$$
\text{Variance} = \mathbb{E}\Big[\big(\hat{f}(x) - \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)]\big)^2\Big]
$$





Where:

* $\hat{f}(x)$ = model prediction  
* $\mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)]$ = expected prediction across datasets

---

## **2. Interpretation**

| Variance Level    | Test Error | Model Behavior                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Variance** | High       | Model overfits → sensitive to noise → poor generalization |
| **Low Variance**  | Low        | Model predictions stable → generalizes well               |

* **High variance → overfit** → good on training data but poor on unseen data
* **Low variance → model stable** → consistent predictions

---

## **3. Visual Intuition**

```
High Variance (Overfitting)
Training data:      *
Model prediction:  *   *   *   *  (changes a lot with each dataset)
Error on test:      large

Low Variance (Good Generalization)
Training data:      *
Model prediction:    *
Error on test:      small
```

---

## **4. Key Notes**

* Variance reflects **model flexibility**
* High variance → model memorizes noise, sensitive to training data
* Variance is **other side of the bias-variance tradeoff**

---

## **5. Memory Hook**

* **“High variance = too flexible → memorizes noise”**
* **“Low variance = stable predictions → generalizes well”**

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| High training error                      | Model fails to fit even the training data               |
| High test error                          | Poor generalization; underfit both train & test         |
| Oversimplified model                     | Decision boundaries too simple; cannot capture patterns |
| Low model complexity                     | Few features, low-degree polynomials, shallow trees     |

# Finding the Right Balance: Avoiding High Bias and High Variance

---

Balancing **bias** and **variance** is crucial to build models that **generalize well**. This is the essence of the **bias-variance tradeoff**.

---

## **1. Assess Model Complexity**

* **Simple models** → high bias, low variance (underfit)
* **Complex models** → low bias, high variance (overfit)

**Action:** Choose model complexity that captures patterns **without memorizing noise**.
Example: Linear regression vs high-degree polynomial regression.

---

## **2. Dataset Size**

* Small datasets → more prone to **high variance**
* Large datasets → variance reduces, model can safely learn complex patterns

**Action:** Increase dataset size when possible; use **data augmentation** if needed.

---

## **3. Regularization**

* **L1 (Lasso)** → removes irrelevant features, reduces variance
* **L2 (Ridge)** → shrinks weights, smooths decision boundaries
* **Elastic Net** → balances both

**Action:** Apply appropriate regularization to **penalize over-complexity** and improve generalization.

---

## **4. Cross-Validation**

* Helps **reliably estimate model performance** across multiple splits
* Detects **overfitting** early
* Techniques: k-fold CV, stratified CV

**Action:** Use cross-validation to **tune hyperparameters** and choose models with **balanced bias and variance**.

---

## **5. Feature Selection (Cherry Picking)**

* Remove irrelevant or noisy features → reduces variance
* Keep important predictive features → avoids high bias

**Action:** Use feature importance, correlation analysis, or domain knowledge to select features.

* **Right side:** Model too complex → low bias, high variance
* **Sweet spot:** Middle → balanced bias and variance → minimum total error
