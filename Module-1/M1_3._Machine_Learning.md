# Machine Learning (ML)

### **Definition**

Machine Learning is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on the development of **algorithms** and **statistical models** that enable computers to **learn from data** and make **predictions or decisions** without being explicitly programmed.

### **Core Components of ML**

1. **Statistics (Math)** – Provides the foundation for data analysis, probability, and prediction.
2. **Computers (Algorithms & Processing Power)** – For training and running ML models.
3. **Data** – The fuel for machine learning. More and better data → better models.

### **Formal Definition (Tom Mitchell)**

> A computer program is said to **learn** from **experience (E)** with respect to some class of **tasks (T)** and a **performance measure (P)**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

 **Example:**

* **E (Experience):** Approving loans
* **T (Task):** Decide whether to approve a new loan
* **P (Performance):** Probability of correctly approving loans for eligible applicants

### **Traditional Problem Solving vs Machine Learning**

| **Traditional Approach**                                                                   | **Machine Learning Approach**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manually define rules for loan approval (age, income, active loans, medical history, etc.) | Provide past loan approval data → ML model learns patterns automatically |
| Hard to scale for complex scenarios                                                        | Scales easily with more data                                             |
| Requires continuous manual updates                                                         | Learns and adapts with new data                                          |

### **Real-World Applications**

* **ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition):** Detects license plates, helps identify stolen vehicles.
* **ChatGPT:** Based on Generative Pretrained Transformers (LLMs that can generate human-like text).
* **Recommender Systems:** Suggests movies, products, or songs based on user preferences (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).
* **Self-Driving Cars:** Uses ML for object detection, lane segmentation, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making.
