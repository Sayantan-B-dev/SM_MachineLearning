## 1. Derivative as Slope (Why Tangent?)

* The **derivative** of a function at a point gives the **slope of the tangent line** at that point.

üëâ Tangent = a straight line that touches the curve at exactly one point, without crossing it (locally).

Diagram intuition:

```
   Curve: J(Œ∏)
        .
       /
      /   ‚Üê slope (derivative)
     /
----‚Ä¢---- tangent at Œ∏
```

* Why tangent?

  * It tells us the **instantaneous rate of change** of the cost function at that parameter value.
  * If slope is steep, cost is changing rapidly ‚Üí big update needed.
  * If slope is flat, cost is almost minimum ‚Üí small update.

## 2. Positive vs Negative Slope

* Update rule:

  $$
  \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta)
  $$

* If slope (derivative) is **positive** ‚Üí

  * Move in the **negative direction** of $\theta$.
  * Example: $\theta = 13 \to 12.9 \to 12 \to 10...$.

* If slope (derivative) is **negative** ‚Üí

  * Move in the **positive direction** of $\theta$.
  * Example: $\theta = 8 \to 8.2 \to 9 \to 10...$.

üëâ Always moving **downhill towards minimum**, no matter slope‚Äôs sign.

## 3. When Slope = 0

* If derivative = 0 ‚Üí slope of cost curve is flat.
* Means we are at the **minimum point**.
* Gradient descent stops here (convergence).

## 4. Effect of Learning Rate ($\alpha$)

$\alpha$ = step size = how far we move in each update.

* **Too small $\alpha$:**

  * Tiny steps, convergence is very slow.
  * Example: takes thousands of iterations to reach minimum.

```
Start .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- Min
```

* **Too large $\alpha$:**

  * Overshoots the minimum.
  * May bounce back and forth, even diverge.

```
Start -----> <----- -----> (oscillating, missing min)
```

* **Good $\alpha$:**

  * Balanced, converges quickly and smoothly.

```
Start ‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí Min
```

## 5. Learning Rate as Hyperparameter

* Called **hyperparameter** because we set it before training.
* Controls:

  * Speed of convergence.
  * Stability of updates.
  * Whether model converges at all.
* ‚ÄúIt defines how my model will be built‚Äù ‚Üí correct, because if $\alpha$ is wrong, the model cannot learn.

---

## 6. How to Choose $\alpha$

There‚Äôs no single formula; common strategies are:

1. **Trial and Error (manual tuning):**

   * Start with small value (e.g. $0.01$).
   * Observe cost function over iterations.
   * If cost decreases slowly ‚Üí increase $\alpha$.
   * If cost oscillates or diverges ‚Üí decrease $\alpha$.

2. **Learning Rate Scheduling:**

   * Start with larger $\alpha$, gradually reduce during training.
   * Helps converge fast in beginning, fine-tune later.

3. **Adaptive Algorithms:**

   * Instead of fixed $\alpha$, use algorithms like **AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam** that adjust learning rate automatically for each parameter.

## 7. Visual Intuition (U-shaped Cost Graph)

```
 Cost J(Œ∏)
   |
   |        .
   |      .
   |   .         <- Too large Œ± ‚Üí overshoot, bounce
   | .
---*--------------------------> Œ∏
  Start

   |
   |     . . . . .            <- Too small Œ± ‚Üí very slow
   |
---*--------------------------> Œ∏
  Start

   |
   |      ‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí               <- Good Œ± ‚Üí smooth convergence
   |
---*--------------------------> Œ∏
  Start
```

## 8. Key Points to Memorize

* Derivative = slope of tangent at that point.
* Positive slope ‚Üí move left, Negative slope ‚Üí move right.
* Slope = 0 ‚Üí convergence (min).
* Learning rate = step size; too small = slow, too large = unstable.
* $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter.
* Choosing $\alpha$: manual tuning, scheduling, or adaptive optimizers.
