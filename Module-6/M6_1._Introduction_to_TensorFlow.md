## Core Components of TensorFlow

### 1. **Tensors**

* **Definition:** Multidimensional arrays used as the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow.
* Example:

  ```
  TensorShape([2, 3])
  Tensor([[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6]])
  ```
* Tensors can represent scalars (0D), vectors (1D), matrices (2D), or higher-order arrays (nD).

---

### 2. **Computation Graphs**

* TensorFlow represents computation as a **graph**, where:

  * **Nodes** = operations (e.g., addition, multiplication)
  * **Edges** = tensors (data flowing between operations)

Example flow:

```
x → W → matmul → +b → ReLU → y_pred
```

---

### 3. **Sessions (TF 1.x)**

Older TensorFlow versions required creating a session to execute the computation graph:

```python
sess = tf.Session()
result = sess.run(y_pred, feed_dict={x: input_data})
```

TensorFlow 2.x uses **Eager Execution**, removing the need for sessions:

```python
y_pred = model(x)
```

---

## TensorFlow 2.x API Levels

### **1. High-Level (Abstracted) API: `tf.keras`**

* Simplified API for deep learning.
* Lets you build and train models easily.
* Example:

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])

  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)
  ```

### **2. Low-Level (Core) API: `tf.*`**

* Provides full control over operations and gradients.
* Example:

  ```python
  x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
  w = tf.Variable([[0.5], [1.0]])
  y = tf.matmul(x, w)
  print(y)
  ```

# What is Keras and How It Relates to TensorFlow

## Definition of Keras

**Keras** is a **high-level neural networks API** designed to make **deep learning fast, easy, and user-friendly**.
It was initially developed by **François Chollet** in 2015 as a standalone library that could run on multiple backends (like TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK).

From **TensorFlow 2.0 onward**, **Keras is fully integrated into TensorFlow** as its **official high-level API**, known as **`tf.keras`**.

---

## Key Characteristics of Keras

Keras is **“an API designed for human beings, not machines.”**
It emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and developer productivity.

### Core Principles of Keras

| Principle                      | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User-Centric Design**        | Designed for humans, not machines; readable, minimal, and intuitive.              |
| **Consistency and Simplicity** | Offers consistent APIs and minimizes user actions for common workflows.           |
| **Actionable Error Messages**  | Provides clear and helpful feedback when something goes wrong.                    |
| **Excellent Documentation**    | High-quality tutorials, guides, and examples for developers and researchers.      |
| **Modularity**                 | Models are made up of configurable building blocks (layers, optimizers, metrics). |
| **Extensibility**              | Easy to write custom layers, losses, and models for research.                     |
| **Compatibility**              | Works seamlessly with TensorFlow’s backend for training and deployment.           |

---

## Relationship Between TensorFlow and Keras

| Aspect           | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integration**  | Keras is part of TensorFlow as `tf.keras`. It uses TensorFlow’s backend engine for all computations.                  |
| **Backend**      | TensorFlow executes the mathematical operations defined by Keras layers.                                              |
| **Purpose**      | TensorFlow = engine, Keras = interface. You can think of TensorFlow as the “power” and Keras as the “steering wheel.” |
| **Code Example** | You write your model in Keras (`tf.keras`), and TensorFlow handles the training and inference.                        |

**Example Analogy:**

* TensorFlow → the **engine and mechanics** of a car
* Keras → the **dashboard and steering wheel** that make driving simple

---

## Keras Model Types

### 1. **Sequential API (Simplest Form)**

Used for stacking layers linearly (one after another).

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

---

### 3. **Subclassing API**

Gives full control over model behavior (useful for custom research).

```python
class MyModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.d1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.d2 = keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, x):
        return self.d2(self.d1(x))
```

---

## Keras Workflow

```
[Prepare Data] → [Build Model] → [Compile Model] → [Train Model] → [Evaluate Model] → [Predict]
```

Example:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

## 2. **Reusable Libraries for Common Model Components**

TensorFlow provides multiple reusable libraries that sit **between Keras and the Core API**, offering modular building blocks for ML models.

| Library                               | Purpose                                    | Example Usage                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`tf.layers`**                       | Predefined neural network layers           | `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, `Conv2D`, `Dropout`                      |
| **`tf.losses`**                       | Common loss functions for training         | `tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()`, `CategoricalCrossentropy()` |
| **`tf.metrics`**                      | Functions to evaluate model performance    | `tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy()`, `Precision()`, `Recall()`          |
| **`tf.optimizers`**                   | Algorithms for minimizing loss             | `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()`, `SGD()`                             |
| **`tf.data`**                         | Efficient data input pipeline creation     | `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()`                            |
| **`tf.image`, `tf.audio`, `tf.text`** | Specialized modules for data preprocessing | Augmentation, tokenization, normalization                         |

These libraries are **modular**, meaning they can be **combined flexibly** to construct and train custom ML architectures.

## 3. **Low-Level TensorFlow Core API**

### Purpose:

Gives **complete control** over the computational graph, gradients, and execution — used mainly by **researchers** or **developers building new algorithms**.

### Core Concepts:

| Concept              | Description                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tensors**          | Multidimensional arrays (basic data structure).                       |
| **Operations (Ops)** | Nodes in a computation graph that perform math (e.g., add, matmul).   |
| **Graphs**           | Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) connecting operations and tensors.     |
| **Variables**        | Trainable parameters in models.                                       |
| **Eager Execution**  | Immediate execution (like normal Python), easier debugging.           |
| **AutoGraph**        | Converts Python code into optimized computation graphs automatically. |

### Example:

```python
x = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0]])
w = tf.Variable([[1.0], [2.0]])
y = tf.matmul(x, w) + 1.0
print(y)  # Executes immediately under eager mode
```

**Purpose of Low-Level API:**

* Create **custom training loops**, loss functions, and optimizers.
* Fine-tune performance and device placement.
* Ideal for **researchers and developers** who need full flexibility.

## 4. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**

TensorFlow’s runtime engine allows the same code to run **seamlessly** on **CPU, GPU, or TPU**.

| Hardware                           | Description                                                                         | Example Use                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**  | Default processor; used for small-scale training or inference.                      | For basic ML tasks or debugging.                            |
| **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** | Parallel processor optimized for matrix operations; speeds up training drastically. | Deep neural networks, CNNs, RNNs.                           |
| **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)**   | Google’s custom ASIC optimized for TensorFlow computations.                         | Large-scale distributed training (e.g., Google Cloud TPUs). |

TensorFlow automatically detects and utilizes available hardware:

```python
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
```

### Optimization Components:

* **XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra):** Compiles TensorFlow graphs for faster execution.
* **TensorFlow Runtime (TFRT):** Manages device communication and memory efficiently.
* **Automatic Device Placement:** Moves operations to the most efficient hardware automatically.

## Execution Flow in TensorFlow

```
Step 1 → You write high-level model code (tf.keras)
Step 2 → Keras uses tf.layers, tf.losses, tf.metrics to define model structure
Step 3 → These are translated into TensorFlow Core Ops (low-level API)
Step 4 → The Core API executes optimized operations on available hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU)
```
