# **Hypothesis Model Representation for Logistic Regression**

---

### 1. **The situation (tumor yes or no)**

* Suppose we want to decide if a tumor is **cancerous (yes)** or **non-cancerous (no)**.
* This is a **binary classification problem**.
* Output $y$ can only be two values:

  $$
  y \in \{0,1\}
  $$

  * $y=0$: tumor is **non-cancerous**
  * $y=1$: tumor is **cancerous**

**Memory hook:** “0 = safe, 1 = danger”

---

### 2. **Hypothesis (model)**

* In logistic regression, we write the hypothesis as:

  $$
  h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
  $$

  where:

  * $\theta_0$ = bias (intercept),
  * $\theta_1$ = weight (slope),
  * $x$ = input feature (e.g., tumor size).

* This is just a **linear score** (like in linear regression).

* Problem: this score can be **any number** (negative, positive, very large).

* But we need an output only between **0 and 1** (probability).

### 3. **Why pass it through sigmoid function?**

* To squash the value into a probability range, we use the **sigmoid function**:

  $$
  S(y) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-y}}
  $$
* Properties of sigmoid:

  * Always between 0 and 1.
  * Looks like an “S-curve” when plotted.
  * At input $y=0$, output is $0.5$.
  * As input $y\to+\infty$, output $\to 1$.
  * As input $y\to-\infty$, output $\to 0$.

So our final hypothesis is:

$$
h_\theta(x) = S(\theta^T x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0+\theta_1x)}}
$$

### 4. **Realistic scenario**

* Suppose tumor size $x=25 \, \text{mm}$.
* Plug into the hypothesis:

  $$
  h_\theta(x) = S(\theta^T x) 
  $$

Let’s imagine after computing we get:

$$
h_\theta(25) = 0.8
$$

---

### 5. **Interpretation of result**

* $h_\theta(25) = 0.8$ means:

  $$
  P(y=1 \mid x=25) = 0.8
  $$

  → Probability that tumor is **cancerous = 80%**.
* Automatically,

  $$
  P(y=0 \mid x=25) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
  $$

  → Probability that tumor is **non-cancerous = 20%**.

**Memory hook:** output = “% chance of being class 1”

---

### 6. **Usefulness**

* Logistic regression does not just give “yes/no”.
* It gives a **probability** → this is very useful in real decisions (like medical diagnosis).
* Doctors can set a **threshold** (for example, 0.5 or stricter like 0.7) to decide.
* Example: If probability ≥ 0.7 → treat as cancerous. If less → monitor.
