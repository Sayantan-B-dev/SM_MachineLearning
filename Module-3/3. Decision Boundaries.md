### Step 1 — Symbols and what we want

* $H(x)$ means: **the model’s output after sigmoid**. It is **not** the raw input $x$. (So $H(x)\neq x$.)
* inside the sigmoid we have a linear score $z$:

  $$
  z = \theta^T x = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \dots
  $$
* final output (the probability of class 1) is the sigmoid of that score:

  $$
  H(x)=S(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}.
  $$

### Step 2 — Why threshold 0.5 ⇔ score $z$ positive (full tiny-step algebra)

Goal: show $S(z) > 0.5 \iff z > 0$.

Start from the definition:

$$
S(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}.
$$

**(A) Show $S(z) > 0.5 \Rightarrow z>0$**

1. Assume $S(z) > 0.5$. That is:

   $$
   \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} > 0.5.
   $$
2. Denominator $1+e^{-z}$ is always **positive** because $e^{-z}>0$ for any real $z$. Multiplying both sides by the positive number $1+e^{-z}$ keeps the inequality direction unchanged:

   $$
   1 > 0.5(1+e^{-z}).
   $$
3. Expand right side:

   $$
   1 > 0.5 + 0.5\,e^{-z}.
   $$
4. Subtract $0.5$ from both sides:

   $$
   0.5 > 0.5\,e^{-z}.
   $$
5. Divide both sides by $0.5$ (positive), inequality direction preserved:

   $$
   1 > e^{-z}.
   $$
6. Since the exponential is positive, take natural log (ln), which is **monotonic increasing** — it preserves inequalities:

   $$
   \ln(1) > \ln(e^{-z}).
   $$
7. Evaluate logs: $\ln(1)=0$ and $\ln(e^{-z})=-z$, so:

   $$
   0 > -z.
   $$
8. Multiply both sides by $-1$. Multiplying by a negative flips the inequality:

   $$
   z > 0.
   $$

Thus $S(z)>0.5 \Rightarrow z>0$.

**(B) Show $z>0 \Rightarrow S(z)>0.5$** (reverse direction)

1. Start with $z>0$. Then $-z<0$.
2. Exponentiate both sides: $e^{-z} < e^{0} = 1$ (since exponential is increasing).
3. Add $1$ to both sides: $1+e^{-z} < 1+1 = 2$.
4. Take reciprocal of both sides; since both sides are positive and reciprocal reverses inequality direction, we get:

   $$
   \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} > \frac{1}{2}.
   $$
5. Left-hand side is $S(z)$, so $S(z) > 0.5$.

Together (A) and (B) give the equivalence:

$$
S(z)>0.5 \iff z>0.
$$

**Key reason summary (one-liner):** sigmoid crosses 0.5 exactly at $z=0$; because sigmoid is strictly increasing, comparing it to 0.5 is the same as checking whether the inside $z$ is positive.

---

### Step 3 — Map that to the model parameters $\theta$

* $z=\theta^T x$. So

  $$
  H(x)>0.5 \iff \theta^T x > 0.
  $$
* Classification rule (using your threshold rule $0.5$):

  $$
  y=\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } H(x)>0.5\ (\text{equivalently } \theta^T x > 0),\\[4pt]
  0 & \text{if } H(x)\le 0.5\ (\text{equivalently } \theta^T x \le 0).
  \end{cases}
  $$
* Reason: sigmoid is monotonic, so threshold on probability becomes threshold on linear score.

**Memory hook:** “Probability > 0.5 ⇔ linear score > 0.”
So the decision is decided by sign of $\theta^T x$.

---

### Step 4 — Decision boundary equation (2D case explained step-by-step)

* In 2 features ($x_1,x_2$), boundary is where model is exactly on the fence: $H(x)=0.5$. That means the inside is zero:

  $$
  \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 = 0.
  $$
* Rearranging to make $x_2$ explicit (solve algebraically for $x_2$), assuming $\theta_2\neq 0$:

  1. Start: $\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 = 0.$
  2. Subtract $\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1$ from both sides:

     $$
     \theta_2 x_2 = -\theta_0 - \theta_1 x_1.
     $$
  3. Divide both sides by $\theta_2$ (if $\theta_2$ positive, inequality directions would be preserved; here it's equality so no direction issue):

     $$
     x_2 = -\frac{\theta_0}{\theta_2} - \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2} x_1.
     $$
* This is the line equation $x_2 = mx_1 + c$ with slope $m = -\theta_1/\theta_2$ and intercept $c = -\theta_0/\theta_2$.

**Interpretation:** the decision boundary is a straight line (in 2D) whose slope and intercept come directly from the weights.

### Step 5 — Worked numeric example, every tiny arithmetic step

Take the commonly used example:

$$
\theta_0 = -3,\quad \theta_1=1,\quad \theta_2=1.
$$

**(A) Write the boundary equation**

1. Plug into $\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 = 0$:

   $$
   -3 + 1\cdot x_1 + 1\cdot x_2 = 0.
   $$
2. Simplify:

   $$
   x_1 + x_2 = 3.
   $$
3. So the decision boundary (where probability = 0.5) is the straight line $x_1 + x_2 = 3$.

**(B) Two easy boundary points (solve step-by-step)**

* If $x_1 = 0$: plug into $x_1 + x_2 = 3$

  * $0 + x_2 = 3$ → $x_2 = 3$. Boundary point $(0,3)$.
* If $x_2 = 0$: plug into line

  * $x_1 + 0 = 3$ → $x_1 = 3$. Boundary point $(3,0)$.

**(C) Classification of sample points (compute z, then sigmoid, then compare to 0.5)**

1. Point $A=(0,0)$

   * Compute linear score $z = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2$:

     * $z = -3 + 1\cdot 0 + 1\cdot 0 = -3 + 0 + 0 = -3.$
   * Compute $e^{-z}$: here $-z = -(-3)=3$, so $e^{-z}=e^{3}$.

     * $e^{3} \approx 20.085536923187668$. (exponential is large because 3 is positive)
   * Compute denominator $1 + e^{-z}$:

     * $1 + 20.085536923187668 = 21.085536923187668.$
   * Compute sigmoid $S(z)=1/(1+e^{-z})$:

     * $S(-3)=1/21.085536923187668 \approx 0.04742587317756678.$
   * Compare to 0.5: $0.0474\le 0.5$ → predict $y=0$ (non-cancerous).
   * Intuition: score is strongly negative so probability of class 1 is very small (\~4.74%).

2. Point $B=(4,0)$

   * Compute $z = -3 + 1\cdot 4 + 1\cdot 0 = -3 + 4 + 0 = 1.$
   * Compute $e^{-z} = e^{-1} \approx 0.36787944117144233.$
   * Denominator $1 + e^{-z} = 1 + 0.36787944117144233 = 1.3678794411714423.$
   * Sigmoid $S(1) = 1 / 1.3678794411714423 \approx 0.7310585786300049.$
   * Compare: $0.73105858 > 0.5$ → predict $y=1$ (cancerous).
   * Intuition: positive score → >50% probability (here ≈73.1%).

3. Point $C=(1,2)$ — a point exactly on the boundary

   * Compute $z = -3 + 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 2 = -3 + 1 + 2 = 0.$
   * Compute $e^{-z} = e^{0} = 1.$
   * Denominator $1 + e^{-z} = 1 + 1 = 2.$
   * Sigmoid $S(0) = 1/2 = 0.5.$
   * Compare per your rule: $H(x)\le 0.5$ → predict $y=0$. (Because you wrote $y=1$ when $S(x)>0.5$, and $y=0$ when $S(x)\le 0.5$.)
   * Note: this point is exactly on the decision boundary. Different practical systems may break ties differently (sometimes class 1 for equality), but your stated rule uses $\le 0.5 \Rightarrow 0$.

---

### Step 6 — Visual / geometric intuition (tiny steps)

* The equation $x_1+x_2=3$ is a straight line in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane.

  * Points where $x_1 + x_2 > 3$ give $z = -3 + x_1 + x_2 > 0$ → $H(x)>0.5$ → predict class **1**.
  * Points where $x_1 + x_2 < 3$ give $z<0$ → $H(x)<0.5$ → predict class **0**.
* So the model splits the plane into two half-planes separated by that line.

**Memory hook:** ask “is $-3 + x_1 + x_2$ positive or negative?” — positive → class 1, negative or zero → class 0.

---

### Quick one-line checklist (for each test point)

1. compute $z=\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1+\theta_2 x_2$.
2. compute $S(z)=1/(1+e^{-z})$ (or just check sign of $z$).
3. if $S(z)>0.5$ (equivalently $z>0$) → predict 1; else predict 0.

---

### Optional extras (kept at the bottom as you asked)

* ASCII sketch of the 2D plane with line $x_1+x_2=3$:

```
 x2
  ^
  |         *  (0,3) boundary
  |       /
  |     /
  |   /
  | /    (region x1+x2>3 -> class 1)
  +------------------> x1
     (region x1+x2<3 -> class 0)
```

* Tie at exactly $S(z)=0.5$ (i.e., $z=0$): your rule made it class 0. That is a design choice; be consistent in implementation.
* If $\theta_2 = 0$ when solving for $x_2$, the boundary is vertical (cannot divide by zero) — treat separately (then boundary is $\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 = 0$, a vertical line in $x_1$–$x_2$ sense).
